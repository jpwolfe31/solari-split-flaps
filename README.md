# solari-split-flaps
Information, designs and code to operate a Solari split-flap display using the Blynk app.

The split-flaps were acquired on eBay in April of 2023.  We were told they were installed at an airport in the 1960s and removed about 20 years ago.  This represents a small portion of the original display.  The electronics that control the display are new and contained in the black box next to the time display.
